# Cyber Security Internship – Task 13

## Task Title
Secure API Testing & Authorization Validation

## Objective
To understand REST APIs and perform basic security testing to validate authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.

## Tool Used
- Postman
- cURL / Insomnia (Conceptual)

## Concepts Covered
- REST API fundamentals
- API authentication testing
- Unauthenticated access testing
- Authorization testing (BOLA)
- Input validation testing
- Rate limiting
- HTTP response code analysis
- OWASP API Security Top Risks

## Testing Performed
- Tested APIs with valid and invalid authentication tokens
- Checked unauthenticated access behavior
- Modified resource identifiers to test authorization
- Sent malformed inputs to test validation
- Observed API response codes and error messages
- Studied rate limiting behavior

## Identified Risks
- Broken Authentication
- Broken Authorization (BOLA)
- Improper Input Validation
- Lack of Rate Limiting
- Excessive Error Information

## Security Recommendations
- Enforce strong authentication
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Apply strict input validation
- Enable rate limiting
- Avoid sensitive error disclosures

## Deliverables
- Secure API Testing & Authorization Validation Report (PDF)

## Outcome
Gained practical understanding of API security testing and common authorization vulnerabilities.
